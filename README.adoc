//= Overview
[partintro]
--
This guide describes the NATS implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder.
It contains information about its design, usage and configuration options, as well as information on how the Stream Cloud Stream concepts map into NATS specific constructs.
--

== Usage

To use the NATS binder, you can add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, by using the following Maven coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-nats</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can use the Spring Cloud Stream NATS Starter, as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-nats</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== NATS Binder Overview

The following simplified diagram shows how the NATS binder operates:

.NATS Binder
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/nats-binder.png[width=300,scaledwidth="50%"]

See <<nats-binder-properties>> for more information about NATS properties.

NOTE: When multiple NATS binders are used in a Spring Cloud Stream application, it is important to disable 'natsAutoConfiguration' to avoid the same configuration from `natsAutoConfiguration` being applied to the two binders.
You can exclude the class by using the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.

== Configuration Options

This section contains settings specific to the NATS Binder and bound channels.

For general binding configuration options and properties, see the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-core-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-stream-overview.adoc#configuration-options[Spring Cloud Stream core documentation].

[[nats-binder-properties]]
=== NATS Binder Properties

The NATS binder supports the following properties:

// TODO
spring.cloud.stream.nats.binder.nodes::
A comma-separated list of NATS node names.
When more than one entry, used to locate the server address where a queue is located.
Each entry in this list must have a corresponding entry in `spring.NATS.addresses`.
Only needed if you use a NATS cluster and wish to consume from the node that hosts the queue.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/reference/html/_reference.html#queue-affinity[Queue Affinity and the LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory] for more information.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.binder.connection-name-prefix::
A connection name prefix used to name the connection(s) created by this binder.
The name is this prefix followed by `#n`, where `n` increments each time a new connection is opened.
+
Default: none.
// TODO - add more...

=== NATS Consumer Properties

NOTE: To avoid repetition, Spring Cloud Stream supports setting values for all channels, in the format of `spring.cloud.stream.default.<property>=<value>`.

The following properties are available for nats consumers only and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.nats.bindings.<channelName>.consumer.`.

maxLength::
The maximum number of messages in the queue.
+
Default: `no limit`
maxLengthBytes::
The maximum number of total bytes in the queue from all messages.
+
Default: `no limit`


=== NATS Producer Properties

NOTE: To avoid repetition, Spring Cloud Stream supports setting values for all channels, in the format of `spring.cloud.stream.default.<property>=<value>`.


The following properties are available for nats producers only and
must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.nats.bindings.<channelName>.producer.`.

// TODO

=== Putting it All Together

The following configuration creates an exchange `myDestination` with queue `myDestination.consumerGroup` bound to a topic exchange with a wildcard routing key `#`:

[source]
---
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=myDestination
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=consumerGroup
---

This configuration creates a DLQ bound to a direct exchange (`DLX`) with a routing key of `myDestination.consumerGroup`.
When messages are rejected, they are routed to the DLQ.
After 5 seconds, the message expires and is routed to the original queue by using the queue name as the routing key, as shown in the following example:

.Spring Boot application
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class NatsApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(XDeathApplication.class, args);
    }

    @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)

    // FIXME
    public void listen(String in) {
      // DO Something
    }

}

[[building]]
== Building

:jdkversion: 1.8

=== Basic Compile and Test

To build the source you will need to install JDK {jdkversion}.

The build uses the Maven wrapper so you don't have to install a specific
version of Maven. To enable the tests, you should have NATS server running
on localhost and the default port (5672)
before building.

The main build command is

----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----

You can also add '-DskipTests' if you like, to avoid running the tests.

NOTE: You can also install Maven (>=3.3.3) yourself and run the `mvn` command
in place of `./mvnw` in the examples below. If you do that you also
might need to add `-P spring` if your local Maven settings do not
contain repository declarations for spring pre-release artifacts.

NOTE: Be aware that you might need to increase the amount of memory
available to Maven by setting a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with
a value like `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`. We try to cover this in
the `.mvn` configuration, so if you find you have to do it to make a
build succeed, please raise a ticket to get the settings added to
source control.


The projects that require middleware generally include a
`docker-compose.yml`, so consider using
https://compose.docker.io/[Docker Compose] to run the middeware servers
in Docker containers.

=== Documentation

There is a "docs" profile that will generate documentation.

`./mvnw clean package -Pdocs -DskipTests`

The reference documentation can then be found in `docs/target/contents/reference`.

=== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
https://www.springsource.com/developer/sts[Spring Tools Suite] or
https://eclipse.org[Eclipse] when working with the code. We use the
https://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs and tools
should also work without issue.

==== Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse
We recommend the https://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin when working with
eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse
marketplace".

Unfortunately m2e does not yet support Maven 3.3, so once the projects
are imported into Eclipse you will also need to tell m2eclipse to use
the `.settings.xml` file for the projects.  If you do not do this you
may see many different errors related to the POMs in the
projects.  Open your Eclipse preferences, expand the Maven
preferences, and select User Settings.  In the User Settings field
click Browse and navigate to the Spring Cloud project you imported
selecting the `.settings.xml` file in that project.  Click Apply and
then OK to save the preference changes.

NOTE: Alternatively you can copy the repository settings from https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/.settings.xml[`.settings.xml`] into your own `~/.m2/settings.xml`.

==== Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse
If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project metadata using the
following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.
[[contributing]]
== Contributing

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup[contributor's agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://github.com/spring-cloud/build/tree/master/eclipse-coding-conventions.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).
